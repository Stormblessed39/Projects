    <h1>The rules for MahJong!</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>Open Tiles</h2>
    <p>A tile is open if there is no tile above or to the immediate left or right.</p>
    <img src="Example.png">
    <p>In this example the Circle 5, W, and E tiles are open because there are no tiles to their left. However, the 5 tile is not open because the Circle 5 tile is to its left.</p>
    <h2>Matchable Tiles</h2>
    <p>A number tile with another number tile of the same rank</p>
    <br>
    <p>A circle tile with another circle tile of the same rank</p>
    <br>
    <p>A bamboo tile with another bamboo tile of the same rank</p>
    <br>
    <p>Any flower tile with any other flower tile</p>
    <br>
    <p>Any season tile with any other season tile</p>
    <br>
    <p>A good rule to remember is that a tile will always match with a tile that looks exactly the same as itself</p>
